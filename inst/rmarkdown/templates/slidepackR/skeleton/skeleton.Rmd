```


```{r}
slidepackR::title_slide(title = "Using DfT's slidepackR", content = "A template to create simple formatted HTML slidepacks", footer = "OFFICIAL SENSITIVE")
```


```{r}
slidepackR::content_slide()
```

## Using this template

* Use the `title_slide()` and `content_slide()` functions to add new slides to your slidepack. 
* Content slides can have any markdown or R content added to them after the initial call, this does not need to be wrapped in the function to display.
* If this is the first time you are using slidepackR slides in a project, you will need to add relevant JS libraries and background images using the *r slidepackR::setup_project()* function.

```{r}
slidepackR::content_slide()
```

## Formatting text

* By default, you will want slide titles to be a second-level header ("##")
* Slide content should not need any markdown formatting

```{r}
slidepackR::format_text("If you would like to format individual lines of text, you can do this using the format_text function to change size, colour or font weight", size = 20, colour = "red", weight = "bolder")

```


```{r}
slidepackR::content_slide()
```


## Two-column layouts

```{r}
slidepackR::even_cols(
  "Even column layouts allow you to have two columns of equal widths",
  "The two columns can contain text, images, charts or tables"
)
```


```{r}
slidepackR::content_slide()
```

## Uneven two column layouts

```{r}
slidepackR::uneven_cols(
  "The uneven column layout has two columns of uneven width; the left column makes up 25% of the total width, and is designed for metadata or information",
  "The right column takes up 75% of the total width, and is ideal for content such as text, images, charts or tables"
)
```
